# mangoO-stable

This is the stable branch of mangoO Microfinance Management. mangoO was initially developed for the SACCO (Savings and Credit Cooperative) of the Anglican Luweero Diocese in Luweero, Uganda.
The development was funded by the Christian Services International (Stuttgart, Germany) and the German government.

## Installation
As mangoO is fully based on web technology, it requires a PHP-capable webserver and a MySQL database. For testing purposes, using XAMPP is recommended.
